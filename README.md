# Final-Year-Project

In this project, two different training methods for Bipedal Walker agents in the Gymnasium environment are compared. Specifically, the performance of a Bipedal Walker agent trained using the reinforcement learning algorithm PPO is compared against an agent trained using CL with PPO as the underlying algorithm. The aim of this study is to assess whether structured curriculum learning can lead to improved learning efficiency, higher mean success rates, and better overall performance in the Bipedal Walker environment.
